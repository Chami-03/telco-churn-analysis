Telco Customer Churn Analysis 📊
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer attrition (churn) for a telecommunications company. By leveraging Power BI, I transformed raw customer data into an interactive dashboard to identify key drivers of churn. The goal is to provide actionable insights that help the management team reduce churn rates, improve customer loyalty, and maximize Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV).

🚀 Key Insights
Total Customers: 7,043

Overall Churn Rate: 26.54% (1,869 customers)

Major Churn Drivers: Month-to-month contracts and Fiber Optic internet users show significantly higher churn rates.

Revenue Impact: Total revenue stands at $16.06M, but churned customers represent a substantial loss in potential recurring revenue.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
Data Visualization: Power BI Desktop

Data Transformation: Power Query

Analytics: DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

Data Source: CSV (Telco Customer Dataset)

📑 Data Cleaning & Modeling
Before building the visuals, the data underwent a rigorous cleaning process:

Data Profiling: Identified missing values in Total Charges and handled them appropriately.

Formatting: Standardized categorical values (e.g., converting binary "Yes/No" to descriptive labels).

Tenure Grouping: Created a conditional column to group customers into "Less than 1 Year" and "1 Year or More" for better trend analysis.

Star Schema: Developed a streamlined data model to ensure efficient filtering and high performance of the dashboard.

📈 Dashboard Features
The interactive dashboard includes:

Executive Summary: High-level KPIs showing Total Customers, Churn Rate, and Revenue.

Contract Analysis: A breakdown of how contract types (Month-to-month vs. Yearly) impact retention.

Payment & Internet Trends: Analysis of churn rates based on payment methods (Electronic checks vs. Credit Cards) and service types (DSL vs. Fiber Optic).

Demographic Insights: Understanding churn behavior across different tenure groups and monthly charge brackets.

💡 Business Recommendations
Based on the analysis, I proposed the following strategies:

Contract Incentives: Offer discounts or value-added services to transition "Month-to-Month" customers into long-term contracts.

Fiber Optic Quality Audit: Investigate why Fiber Optic users have higher churn rates—potential issues could include pricing or service stability.

Targeted Retention: Implement a proactive outreach program for customers in their first 6–12 months, as this is the highest risk period.
